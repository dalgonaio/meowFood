meowFood!


## My Inspiration:
If more people were like cats - chilling and napping all day, there would be less fights let alone wars. To achieve this goal, meowFood lets you check out restaurants in your city that deliver to you. Relax and enjoy the sun as food magically appears!

## Try Out the App:
If you want to test this app, the prerequisite is that you have Expo installed on your device.

While this app is in development, beta testers can try it out by cloning this repo, using the terminal to navigate to the main directory, running "npm install" and then running "npm start". The start script will then open Expo where you will be prompted to view in the simulator of your choice.

An alternate to running the app in a simulator is to install Expo on a mobile device, run the start script from the terminal, and then scan the QR code.
